\section{Introduction}
On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) office in China was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City, Hubei Province \cite{WHO_2020}. Subsequently, using new generation sequencing methods, a new Coronavirus designated 2019-nCOV was identified as the etiologic agent. Most patients developed a self-limiting disease, but a percentage progress with the appearance of pulmonary infiltrates, hypoxemia and acute respiratory failure (SARS-CoV2) \cite{Lu_2020}. The evolution of the infection and the verification of the possibility of person-to-person transmission added to a rapid multiplication of the number of cases in China and the subsequent extension to other countries, led to the March 11 2020 WHO declares COVID 19 infection as a pandemic \cite{WHO_2020_2}. By April 2020, the number of infected exceeded one million and the number of deaths was more than one hundred thousand. Apart of the respiratory failure, patients with COVID-19 infection develop hematological disfunction with hyperferritinemia, coagulopaty and thrombosis been the more frequent. In this review we summarize the hematological manifestations of COVID-19 infection and provide topics in the treatment of hematological patients during pandemics.
